# Skystore
The public community bot for the discord server SKYNET that anyone can contribute to.
The bot is ran by volcanicer. I'll be hosting and managing the development of this bot. You can contact me @ discord: **volcanicer#4216**
This bot is __not__ Moderation focused. This bot is mainly for having fun and an economy.

## Some Guidelines
- You must be using discord.py's rewrite branch.
- The code cannot be malicious.
- You can't claim this bot as your own. While it is created by the community, it's still respectful to value other people's work.
- We're planning on making this bot public for anyone's use, so please keep the commands usable in any guild with the proper checks.
- You must be able to use a SQLite database. If you need to refer to the documentation, I suggest going [here](https://docs.python.org/3.7/library/sqlite3.html).
